# Pyquencer
This is a rep for the Pyquencer python script that runs on the WavPlay.gb aduio sequencer
Pyquencer is a piece of software that allows you to creat your own song using a 16 step sequencer with up to 6 voices 

It was designed to run on the WavPlay.gb, an Rpi Zero 2W based Handheld device similar to a gameboy 
that can be used to sequence sounds. 

If you intrested in working on and improving the software or in buiding your own WavPlay.gb you are in the right Rep ;)

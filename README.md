## Setting up the SD card and USB

Fist you will want to set up the SD card. For that you simply need to flash our custom img file using 
the Raspberry Pi Imager.

To set up the USB first format it to Fat32 and rename it to PYQUENCER (all caps).
Than Download the Usb_Root folder on github.
Unzip the Saves, Library and Songs folders and add all the folders of USB_Root to your USB

Congrats. You are all set. Plug the SD card and USB in your Wav_Play.GB and go wild

#### Installing the Battery

Battery installation is highly dependent of the size of your battery. 
We recoment using a battery with the dimensions: 54x34x10mm
Those dismensions work perfectly with JRodrigos battery holder design 
over on Thingivers (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1418834)![Power_managment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77835905/219465759-4763771f-11c3-41a5-bc06-043ad4fdbab0.png)


Simply guide the two leads of your battery through the little hole on the left of the holder 
and torugh the hole in the gameboy case. 
Put the holder and the battery in the compartment using the springs to hold it in place.
Close the compartment and you are done.
